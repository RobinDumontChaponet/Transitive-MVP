# Transitive-project

An empty project using Transitive\Core.

This is not the only way to use Transitive. Modify to your need.

```sh
composer create-project transitive/project projectName && cd $_
```
*This command will create a new project replacing every occurence of "projectName" in templates of README, LICENCE, CHANGELOG, index.php, etc.*
